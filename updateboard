Welcome back to Skwurl Runner everyone!

This update aims to *darken*, the mood a little, with the introduction of shadows.

The next update will be the optimazation update, which will make the game run much smoother, and hopefully reduce file sizes!

Back on shadows though. The shadows from trees in the main area aren't working, but I am working on a fix for it!
