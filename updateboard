You guys may have noticed that updates haven't been coming out that frequently lately, and i thought that i would explain why. I love Skwurl Runner, and I always will, but I am currently burnt out of working on it, and I don't see myself making updates for another couple of weeks. But I am starting to work on another game, that I will announce here in a couple of days, hopefully
